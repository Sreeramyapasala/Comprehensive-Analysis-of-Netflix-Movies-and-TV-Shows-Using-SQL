### INTRODUCTION:
Netflix, a leading global streaming platform, offers a vast library of movies and TV shows. To understand the
platform's content strategy and audience preferences, a comprehensive analysis of its content is essential.
This project aims to analyze Netflix's content data using SQL to gain valuable insights and answer various
business questions. By exploring factors such as content type distribution (movies vs. TV shows), common
ratings, release years, country-wise contributions, and durations, we aim to answer critical business questions.
The analysis will also categorize content based on keywords and other criteria, helping to better understand
Netflix’s content strategy and audience preferences.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To find patterns and trends that might affect business choices is difficult due to Netflix's extensive and diverse
content. The goal of this project is to analyse Netflix's material in order to identify important elements including
user preferences, genre popularity, regional contributions, and content type distribution. This will help with
data-driven decision-making for next content creation and purchase.
Theory for Analysis of Netflix:
The following analysis will focus on several key aspects of Netflix's content:
Theory for Analysis has been enhanced to reflect how the structured SQL queries address the project
objectives. Netflix has a well-balanced content library, offering a mix of movies and TV shows to cater to
diverse audience tastes. While the specific proportions may vary over time, analyzing these trends can reveal
interesting insights. For instance, a larger proportion of TV shows might indicate a focus on binge-worthy
content, while a higher percentage of movies could suggest a preference for standalone narratives.
Understanding the characteristics of Netflix's content is essential for delivering personalized recommendations.
Analyzing the distribution of ratings can help identify popular genres and content themes. Additionally,
examining the geographic distribution of content can reveal regional preferences, allowing Netflix to tailor its
offerings to specific markets.
Netflix's vast library is organized into various genres and categories. By analyzing the popularity of different
genres, we can identify audience preferences and tailor recommendations accordingly. Furthermore, examining
the use of keywords can help understand content themes and identify emerging trends, enabling Netflix to stay
ahead of the curve.
The analysis of Netflix's content provides valuable insights for business decisions. Understanding audience
preferences can guide content acquisition and production, ensuring that Netflix continues to offer content that
resonates with its viewers. By comparing Netflix's content with that of competitors, we can identify
opportunities and challenges in the streaming market, allowing Netflix to maintain a competitive edge.

### Dataset Details:
Source: The dataset is a simulated database created using SQL, modeled after Netflix's content offerings. Data
is inserted into tables such as shows, directors, casts, genres, and countries
Structure: Tables represent relationships between shows and key entities (directors, casts, genres, and
countries).
Scope: The dataset includes various fields like title, director, cast, release year, rating, and duration, offering
comprehensive coverage for analysis.

### Project Goals
 Develop SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
 Identify content trends, regional preferences, and popular genres.
 Generate actionable business recommendations for Netflix based on data findings.
Objectives/Goals:
1. Each movie or TV show belongs to exactly one content type (movie or TV show); there can be zero
to infinite titles of each type.
2. Each title has exactly one rating; a rating can be associated with multiple titles.
3. Each title can belong to multiple genres; each genre can include zero to infinite titles.
4. Each user can engage with zero to infinite titles through ratings, reviews, or sharing; each title can
receive feedback from multiple users.
5. Multiple data sources may contribute to the analysis, including public APIs or datasets from Netflix
and other platforms.
